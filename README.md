# Proj: BritSongBird
This is the term project for CAS MA615, Fall 2025. 

In this project, I created an app using the shiny package that allows you to 
explore the various aspects of a dataset containing information about the 
songbirds commonly found in the British Isles (and the surrounding regions). 

In the development of this app, I employed everything I learnt in the class 
this semester, including: R programming, exploratory data analysis, Shiny, 
geospatial data analysis.
